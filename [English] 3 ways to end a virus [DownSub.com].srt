1
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:08,546
It’s spring 2021.

2
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:11,758
The Alpha variant of the coronavirus
has spread rapidly,

3
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:14,218
becoming the dominant variant worldwide.

4
00:00:14,552 --> 00:00:18,181
But another, more transmissible
variant is about to appear—

5
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:19,348
Delta.

6
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:22,101
What happens when two variants clash?

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,895
Let’s do a thought experiment.

8
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:28,024
Suppose that the variants reach 
a hypothetical isolated city

9
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:31,944
of 1 million people who are 
completely susceptible to both viruses

10
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:33,279
on the same day.

11
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:37,533
When a person here is infected with Alpha,
they transmit it to,

12
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,328
on average, 5 close contacts,

13
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:43,873
then begin to feel sick 
and immediately isolate themselves

14
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,374
for the rest of the simulation.

15
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,627
The same thing happens with Delta,

16
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:53,424
except that an infected person transmits
it to, on average, 7.5 close contacts.

17
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,676
What would you guess happens next?

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,265
After six days, 
Alpha will have infected 15,625 people.

19
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:05,394
Delta will have infected
more than 10 times as many.

20
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:10,566
Just 20 hours later, Delta will have
infected the rest of the population—

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,903
all before Alpha could infect 6% of it.

22
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:17,115
With no one left to infect, 
Alpha dies out.

23
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,617
This model is
drastically simplified,

24
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:24,038
but it accurately reflects one thing 
that did happen in real life:

25
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:25,832
when both variants competed,

26
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:29,293
Delta drove Alpha
towards extinction in a matter of weeks.

27
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:32,964
Viruses are wildly successful organisms.

28
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:37,385
There are about 100 million times
as many virus particles on Earth

29
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:41,055
as there are stars 
in the observable universe.

30
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,976
Even so, viruses can and do go extinct.

31
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:48,062
There are three main ways that can happen.

32
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,898
First, a virus could run out of hosts.

33
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:57,071
This might have happened in early 2020
to a flu lineage known as B/Yamagata.

34
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,367
When much of the world shut down, 
social distanced, and wore masks

35
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,619
to slow the spread of COVID 19,

36
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,166
that dramatically reduced the number of
hosts available for B/Yamagata to infect.

37
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:11,169
It’ll take a few more flu seasons 
to know for sure

38
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:15,089
if it’s truly extinct or just
hiding out in an animal reservoir.

39
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:17,884
Many viruses, as part of their life cycle,

40
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:21,053
cause diseases severe enough 
to kill their hosts.

41
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:25,057
This can be a problem because
if a virus kills all its hosts,

42
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:29,604
it could— in theory— run out of hosts
to infect and go extinct.

43
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:33,858
This almost happened 
back in 1950s Australia.

44
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:39,780
At the time, Australia was overrun by the
European rabbit— an invasive species—

45
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,783
so, in an attempt to control
the population,

46
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,703
scientists released a virus
called myxoma,

47
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:51,083
which had been previously shown to be
almost 100% lethal to European rabbits.

48
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,877
During the initial outbreak,

49
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:57,298
as planned, tens, perhaps hundreds, 
of millions of European rabbits died.

50
00:02:57,423 --> 00:03:01,385
But as the virus spread, 
it evolved a series of mutations

51
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:03,721
that happened to make it less deadly,

52
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:07,391
killing rabbits more slowly 
and killing fewer rabbits overall.

53
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:10,937
With more infected hosts hopping around,

54
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:15,316
this strain of the virus was more likely
to spread than its deadlier cousin.

55
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:19,987
And of course, rabbits evolved too, 
to mount better immune responses.

56
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:23,032
Overall, instead of killing 
every single rabbit,

57
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,535
the virus evolved, 
the rabbit population bounced back,

58
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:28,371
and both survived.

59
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,123
The second way a virus could go extinct

60
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:34,085
is if humans fight back 
with an effective vaccine—

61
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,086
and win.

62
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:39,882
Vaccination campaigns have driven 
two viruses essentially to extinction

63
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,551
since vaccines were invented in the 1800s:

64
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:46,013
smallpox and rinderpest, 
which kills cattle.

65
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,807
More on vaccination later.

66
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:51,394
The third way a virus can go extinct 
is if it’s outcompeted

67
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:53,229
by another virus or strain,

68
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,773
like we saw earlier with Delta and Alpha.

69
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:59,068
By the way, viruses don't always
compete with each other.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,863
A viral species can carve 
out its own distinct niche—

71
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:05,825
for example, influenza infects
your respiratory tract,

72
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,995
and norovirus infects cells
in your intestine,

73
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:11,706
so both of these viruses can co-exist.

74
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:15,543
A virus’ ecological niche can be tiny:

75
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:20,631
hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses
can infect the same cell—

76
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,219
hep B occupies the nucleus, 
and hep C occupies the cytoplasm.

77
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:30,558
In fact, epidemiologists estimate that 
2 to 10% of people with hep C

78
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,893
are also infected with hep B.

79
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:35,271
So, will SARS-CoV-2—

80
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:38,107
the species of virus that causes COVID 19—

81
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:39,483
ever go extinct?

82
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:43,863
Variants within the species
will continue to arise.

83
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,783
Those variants might drive prior
ones to extinction, or not.

84
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:50,661
Regardless of how the variants compete
(or don’t),

85
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:54,206
the species itself— 
to which all the variants belong—

86
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,959
is pretty firmly established among humans.

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,173
If we managed to vaccinate enough people,
could we drive SARS-CoV-2 to extinction?

88
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:05,426
Our vaccination campaign 
against smallpox worked

89
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:08,637
because the vaccine was highly protective
against infection

90
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:12,808
and smallpox had no close animal reservoir
in which it could hide.

91
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:16,103
But SARS-CoV-2 can hide out in animals,

92
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:17,563
and our current vaccines—

93
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:21,233
while they provide excellent protection
against severe illness and death—

94
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,569
don't prevent all infections.

95
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:28,115
So, conceivably there are two ways
that SARS-CoV-2—

96
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:30,868
the entire species— 
could go extinct:

97
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:34,580
a cataclysmic disaster could kill us all.

98
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,581
Or...

99
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:40,503
We could invent a universal vaccine
that prevents all SARS-CoV-2 infections—

100
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:44,965
those caused by all the variants 
that currently exist and those that don’t.

101
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,468
Let's work toward that second option.
