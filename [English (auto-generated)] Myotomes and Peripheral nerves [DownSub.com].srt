1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,129
okay we're gonna talk about my tums and

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,720
peripheral nerves and answer the

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,420
question what motor deficits occur when

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,309
you injure a root of the brachial plexus

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,800
in contrast to injuring a peripheral

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,080
nerve hello everyone my name is dr.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,929
Morton and I'm the noted anatomist so

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,470
did as we go through this tutorial the

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,369
basic understanding of the brachial

10
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,590
plexus would be necessary and you may

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,390
not have to label everything like this

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,609
but you should have an understanding and

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,470
if you need some help just look at the

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,779
link below to take you to a tutorial on

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,450
the overview of the brachial plexus now

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,790
a Maya tome is my tomes our muscles

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,950
supplied by motor neurons from a single

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,860
spinal root level and so here the c5 c6

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,309
c7 c8 in t1 levels and the actions

20
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,879
associated with those Maya tomes and so

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,440
I'm gonna ask a question what peripheral

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
nerves transport now the motor neurons

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,640
from the spinal cord level to the

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,860
various muscle groups and so there we

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,300
have it we called the brachial plexus

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,030
and so here's the c5 Maya tone which is

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,190
shoulder a B duction primarily the

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,930
deltoid and that shoulder abduction

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,299
looks like this from this position to

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,729
this position and the axillary nerve is

31
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,530
what innervates the deltoid muscle that

32
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,750
results in shoulder a deduction so the

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,640
axillary nerve is what's transporting

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,830
motor neurons from the c5 spinal cord

35
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,460
level to the deltoid how about the c6

36
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,290
Maya tone with elbow flexion of the

37
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,990
biceps well that is what elbow flexion

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,150
looks like and the biceps muscles

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,850
innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve

40
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,670
so muscular taneous nerve takes motor

41
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,040
neurons from the ventral horn cells of

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,740
the c6 spinal cord level and is

43
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,869
transporting those motor neurons to the

44
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:40,530
biceps

45
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,829
how about c7 might own well that's elbow

46
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,810
extension and that's the triceps and it

47
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,060
looks like this from this position to

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,880
this position and the radial nerve it's

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,670
was transporting c7 motor neurons

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,340
what about c8 with wrist flexion well

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,990
that's what wrist and finger flexion

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,270
looked like from here to here and the

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,219
meeting and alder nerves are what are

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,979
transporting motor neurons to the flexor

55
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,140
digitorum superficialis and profundus

56
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,590
muscles what about t1 while finger a b

57
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,930
duction looks like that from here to

58
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,920
there and the doors

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,230
in Rossi I do that and the owner nervous

60
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,810
was transporting those motor neurons so

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,790
let's do a practice question so what

62
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,230
spinal cord level is primarily

63
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,380
responsible for this action and then

64
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,569
there's our Associated segmental spinal

65
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,090
cord levels well that's wrist flexion

66
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,850
which means the c8 spinal cord levels

67
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,380
responsible for it so there are the

68
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,230
wrist flexors flexor carpi radialis

69
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,780
flexor digitorum superficialis flexor

70
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,880
digitorum profundus half of it flexor

71
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,680
digitorum profundus the other half of it

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
and flexor carpi ulnaris so the wrist

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,600
flexor muscles are innervated by motor

74
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,819
neurons these muscles are innervated by

75
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,470
motor neurons that arise from the c8

76
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,459
spinal cord level Shing like that

77
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,830
so what peripheral nerves transport the

78
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,989
motor neurons from the c8 spinal cord

79
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,730
level to these various wrist flexor

80
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,489
muscles so there's the brachial plexus

81
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,540
so what are those two nerves

82
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,730
it's the median and ulnar nerve that are

83
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,980
doing it all right so the wrist flexor

84
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,810
muscles are innervated by motor neurons

85
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,819
that arise from the c8 spinal cord level

86
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,830
and are transported by way of the

87
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,180
meeting in ulnar nerves so peripheral

88
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,130
nerves are muscles that are supplied by

89
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,739
motor neurons from a single peripheral

90
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,750
nerve now these peripheral nerves may

91
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,250
contain more than one spinal cord level

92
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,630
let's do a practice question if the

93
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,609
following neurons those ones were

94
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:36,329
injured

95
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,239
what would most likely occur all wrist

96
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,489
flexion would be affected no change in

97
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,470
wrist flexion some wrist flexion would

98
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,870
be affected so pause and think about it

99
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,790
for a second and I'm gonna continue if

100
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,579
you just knock out the ulnar nerve some

101
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,079
wrist flexion would be affected because

102
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,620
the flexor carpi radialis superficialis

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,840
flexor digitorum superficialis and half

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,859
of the FDP

105
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,440
would be okay because the median nerve

106
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,569
is unaffected only the owner

107
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,310
contribution to wrist flexion would be

108
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,470
affected how about this one if the

109
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,120
following neurons there were injured

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,690
what would most likely happen pause look

111
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,918
at the choices and think about it I'm

112
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,250
now continuing the answer to this one is

113
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,140
that all wrist flexion would be affected

114
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,330
the reason being look at you've knocked

115
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,849
out all motor neurons coming from c8 so

116
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,020
all those motor

117
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,240
going in the median and ulnar nerves

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,419
would be affected so let's look at this

119
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,610
picture these pictures what spinal cord

120
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,440
levels primarily responsible for these

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,509
images well there is elbow flexion and

122
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,610
sensation of the thumb and the brachial

123
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,069
radialis reflex well the answer is the

124
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,130
c6 neurological level and so there are

125
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,650
all those neurons associate connecting

126
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,650
back and forth either sensory 2 or motor

127
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,910
from the tissues and spinal cord

128
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,060
so what nerves are now peripheral

129
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,880
branches of the brachial plexus are

130
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,110
transporting these well I mean let's

131
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,889
take a look at that

132
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,599
the one up there for flexion of the

133
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,300
elbow that's musculocutaneous nerve

134
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,590
sensation of the thumb that's median

135
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,900
nerve and brachioradialis reflex both

136
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,560
motor and sensory that's a radial nerve

137
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,020
if the following was injured right there

138
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,169
what would most likely happen pause and

139
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,050
read through those choices and think of

140
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,120
the answer I'm gonna continue the answer

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,969
to this is see you would lose sensation

142
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,880
only in the median nerve sensory field

143
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,460
for the thumb that's right there why

144
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,469
well musculocutaneous nerve is

145
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:42,389
unaffected because elbow flexion is

146
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,250
still able to go because the

147
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,169
musculocutaneous nerve is okay and

148
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,330
brachial radialis reflex is okay because

149
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,330
the radial nerve is not affected how

150
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,009
about if the following injury was here

151
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,620
what would happen pause and think

152
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,819
through this as you look through the

153
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,210
choices I'm going to continue the answer

154
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,849
is loss of the brachioradialis reflex

155
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,050
and why only that

156
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,030
well the musculocutaneous and median

157
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,490
nerves are unaffected so elbow flexion

158
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,940
and sensation of the thumb would be okay

159
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,620
how about if the Fallen injury what if

160
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,240
the injury was there what would most

161
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,159
likely occur pause and read through the

162
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:20,250
choices and think about it I'm going

163
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,699
forward the answer is basically you're

164
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,009
knocking out the entire c6 neurological

165
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,389
level look at that you knock out the

166
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,159
ventral ramus on c6

167
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,590
you cannot get motor neurons to the

168
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,900
musculocutaneous nerve or through the

169
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,479
radial nerve and you cannot get sensory

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,000
neurons from proprioceptors in the

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,490
brachioradialis muscle or

172
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,560
sensory neurons from the median nerve of

173
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,770
the thumb now you'll notice then so

174
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,569
that's why I highlighted and underlined

175
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,759
a but then Beast D and E would be

176
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,190
affected but I said lose sensation in

177
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,780
the median nerve sensory field why

178
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,300
didn't I include that what we would

179
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,789
knock out from the c6 level but remember

180
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,039
the median nerve also does your swear

181
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,340
finger which is the c7 dermatome so you

182
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,720
would still be able to get sensory

183
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
neurons there okay so now what about

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,710
let's do some tracing trace sensory

185
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,300
motor neurons in the median nerve so

186
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,130
there's our median nerve in the

187
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,960
cutaneous field and on the brachial

188
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,940
plexus so let's follow sensory neurons

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,909
from the thumb go to the c6 level how

190
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,099
about the middle finger the swear finger

191
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,060
to c7 how about to the c8 spinal cord

192
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,889
level there's our motor neurons going to

193
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,500
the wrist flexors and how about t1 going

194
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,840
to our intrinsic an muscles and then the

195
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,520
median nerve case basically our thenor

196
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,770
muscles you'll hear notice then that the

197
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,710
median nerve has four different segments

198
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,780
of the spinal cord associated with it

199
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,020
but the c6 and c7 are primarily sensory

200
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,539
and the c8 and t1 are primarily motor

201
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,909
how about the ulnar nerve well there's

202
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:56,430
our older nerve cutaneous field and we

203
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,590
follow the sensation all the way back to

204
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,800
the c8 dermatome level and let's take a

205
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,380
look now the c8 Myatt ohm level that

206
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,900
goes to wrist flexors and then the t1

207
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,020
goes to intrinsic and muscles primarily

208
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,990
everything at hypothenar lumbricals and

209
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,300
so forth so Myatt ohms if you injure a

210
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,380
root or trunk

211
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,000
you're gonna lose strength in its

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,699
associated Maya tone if you injure a

213
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,110
peripheral nerve you're gonna lose

214
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,569
strength in all the associated muscles

215
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,569
and that my friends is the Maya tome and

216
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,219
peripheral nerves in a nutshell

217

218
