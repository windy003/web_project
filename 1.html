00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
In this lecture we’re gonna cover 
the pharmacology of antifungal drugs  

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,640
so let’s get right into it. The similarity 
of fungal and mammalian cells creates a  

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,280
number of challenges for designing drugs 
that are selectively toxic to fungal cells  

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,440
but not to our own cells. The only significant 
difference between fungal and mammalian cells  

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,480
are the presence of fungal cell walls and a small 
structural difference in the plasma membrane.  

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,520
Now, the cell wall of most fungi 
is composed of mannoproteins  

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,800
and rigid layers of complex polysaccharides; 
β-1,3 and β-1,6-linked glucans as well as chitin.  

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,200
Being external, the cell wall offers 
mechanical strength and acts as a barrier,  

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,800
thus protecting the fungus from the hostile 
environment. Underneath this wall lies the  

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,160
plasma membrane made up of phospholipid bilayer. 
The major sterol found in fungal plasma membranes  

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,240
called ergosterol, acts to maintain membrane 
integrity in the same capacity as cholesterol,  

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,520
which is the major sterol found in mammalian 
cell membranes. Lastly, the plasma membrane  

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,400
also houses multisubunit enzymes that are 
responsible for fungal cell wall construction. 

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
Now, because of its crucial functions and unique 
structural properties, ergosterol is the target  

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,480
for many antifungal medications. One of them 
is a broad-spectrum anti-fungal drug called  

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,760
Amphotericin B. Amphotericin B works by binding to 
ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane and forming  

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,080
pores that cause rapid leakage of intracellular 
ions ultimately leading to fungal cell death.  

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,080
In addition to its fungicidal activity, 
unfortunately Amphotericin B can also bind  

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,640
to cholesterol molecules found in human 
cell membranes, although with relatively  

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,720
lower affinity. This however has major adverse 
consequences because binding to cholesterol  

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,320
also leads to the formation of pores that increase 
membrane permeability particularly in the renal  

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,160
vasculature and renal epithelial cells, 
which can ultimately lead to nephrotoxicity.  

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,080
Because of this, Amphotericin B is typically 
reserved only for treatment of severe systemic  

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,120
infections that require a rapid response.
Now, another antifungal that also binds  

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,920
to ergosterol causing leakage of intracellular 
components is a drug called Nystatin. Although  

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Nystatin has the same mechanism of action as 
Amphotericin B, Nystatin is more toxic and because  

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,800
of that it is not used systemically. Nystatin is 
also not absorbed from mucous membranes and skin,  

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,320
which is why its use has been largely limited to 
the treatment of superficial Candida infections  

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:56,640
of the mouth, skin, intestinal tract and vagina.
All right, so besides targeting ergosterol itself,  

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,880
many other antifungal drugs have been designed 
to target enzymes involved in ergosterol  

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,760
biosynthesis. Now, the ergosterol biosynthesis 
in fungi utilizes a compound called squalene as  

32
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,160
a starting material. In the presence of an enzyme 
called squalene epoxidase, squalene is transformed  

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,240
into lanosterol, which in the presence of a 
cytochrome P450 enzyme called 14α-demethylase,  

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,840
is subsequently converted to ergosterol. Now 
fungal squalene epoxidase is the target of a group  

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,080
of potent antifungals called allylamines, which 
include drugs such as Naftifine and Terbinafine,  

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,600
as well as allylamine derivative 
drug called Butenafine. 

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,040
The next enzyme, 14α-demethylase is the target 
of a group of antifungals called azoles, which  

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,920
include drugs such as Clotrimazole, Fluconazole, 
Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, Miconazole,  

39
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,040
and Voriconazole. Now, by inhibiting squalene 
epoxidase and 14α-demethylase, allylamines and  

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,440
azole antifungal agents deplete cell membrane 
ergosterol thereby impairing membrane fluidity,  

41
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,320
leading to accumulation of toxic sterols, 
and ultimately causing fungal cell death.  

42
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,079
That being said, both squalene epoxidase and 
14α-demethylase are also present in human cells,  

43
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,520
and although human enzymes are less affected than 
the fungal enzymes, there is still a potential for  

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,000
non-targeted inhibition, which can lead to many 
adverse effects. One of the prime examples of this  

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,680
is the non-targeted inhibition of 
human drug-metabolizing cytochrome  

46
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,160
P450 enzymes by azoles, which is responsible 
for many pharmacokinetic drug interactions. 

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,240
Now, in addition to ergosterol, another unique 
component of the fungal cell wall, which also  

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,240
serves as an attractive pharmacological target 
for antifungal drugs is beta-glucan. Specifically,  

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,800
some antifungal drugs have been designed to 
target an enzyme located in the fungal plasma  

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,680
membrane that is responsible for the production of 
β(1-3)-glucans called β-(1,3)-glucan synthase. The  

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,280
class of compounds known as echinocandins inhibits 
β-glucan synthase, which leads to a decrease  

52
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,040
of β-glucans in the cell wall thereby causing 
osmotic instability, and ultimately cell lysis.  

53
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,480
The example of drugs that belong to this class 
are; Anidulafungin, Caspofungin, and Micafungin.  

54
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,320
Now, the major advantages of echinocandins 
relative to other antifungals include their  

55
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,120
activity against azole-resistant Candida 
strains as well as Aspergillus species.  

56
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,760
Furthermore, because the enzyme 
system for beta-glucan synthesis  

57
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,440
is absent in human cells, 
unlike the other antifungals,  

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,320
echinocandins have relatively low potential 
for toxicity or serious drug interactions. 

59
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Finally before we end, I wanted to briefly 
mention couple more antifungal drugs that  

60
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,760
you may encounter in clinical practice, that 
is; Griseofulvin and Flucytosine. So unlike the  

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,440
cell-wall-targeting antifunglas that we discussed 
thus far, Griseofulvin and Flucytosine work by  

62
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,560
disrupting fungal cell division via mechanisms 
similar to cancer chemotherapeutic agents.  

63
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,160
Specifically, Griseofulvin binds to 
tubulin, disrupting microtubule function  

64
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,680
and inhibiting fungal cell mitosis, while 
Flucytosine works at the nucleus level where  

65
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,080
it is converted into 5-fluorouracil 
and then to other active metabolites  

66
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,480
that inhibit fungal RNA and DNA synthesis.
And with that I wanted to thank you for watching,  

67
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,840
I hope you found this video useful 
and as always stay tuned for more.
