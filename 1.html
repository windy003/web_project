In this lecture we’re gonna cover 
the pharmacology of antifungal drugs  

so let’s get right into it. The similarity 
of fungal and mammalian cells creates a  

number of challenges for designing drugs 
that are selectively toxic to fungal cells  

but not to our own cells. The only significant 
difference between fungal and mammalian cells  

are the presence of fungal cell walls and a small 
structural difference in the plasma membrane.  

Now, the cell wall of most fungi 
is composed of mannoproteins  

and rigid layers of complex polysaccharides; 
β-1,3 and β-1,6-linked glucans as well as chitin.  

Being external, the cell wall offers 
mechanical strength and acts as a barrier,  

thus protecting the fungus from the hostile 
environment. Underneath this wall lies the  

plasma membrane made up of phospholipid bilayer. 
The major sterol found in fungal plasma membranes  

called ergosterol, acts to maintain membrane 
integrity in the same capacity as cholesterol,  

which is the major sterol found in mammalian 
cell membranes. Lastly, the plasma membrane  

also houses multisubunit enzymes that are 
responsible for fungal cell wall construction. 

Now, because of its crucial functions and unique 
structural properties, ergosterol is the target  

for many antifungal medications. One of them 
is a broad-spectrum anti-fungal drug called  

Amphotericin B. Amphotericin B works by binding to 
ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane and forming  

pores that cause rapid leakage of intracellular 
ions ultimately leading to fungal cell death.  

In addition to its fungicidal activity, 
unfortunately Amphotericin B can also bind  

to cholesterol molecules found in human 
cell membranes, although with relatively  

lower affinity. This however has major adverse 
consequences because binding to cholesterol  

also leads to the formation of pores that increase 
membrane permeability particularly in the renal  

vasculature and renal epithelial cells, 
which can ultimately lead to nephrotoxicity.  

Because of this, Amphotericin B is typically 
reserved only for treatment of severe systemic  

infections that require a rapid response.
Now, another antifungal that also binds  

to ergosterol causing leakage of intracellular 
components is a drug called Nystatin. Although  

Nystatin has the same mechanism of action as 
Amphotericin B, Nystatin is more toxic and because  

of that it is not used systemically. Nystatin is 
also not absorbed from mucous membranes and skin,  

which is why its use has been largely limited to 
the treatment of superficial Candida infections  

of the mouth, skin, intestinal tract and vagina.
All right, so besides targeting ergosterol itself,  

many other antifungal drugs have been designed 
to target enzymes involved in ergosterol  

biosynthesis. Now, the ergosterol biosynthesis 
in fungi utilizes a compound called squalene as  

a starting material. In the presence of an enzyme 
called squalene epoxidase, squalene is transformed  

into lanosterol, which in the presence of a 
cytochrome P450 enzyme called 14α-demethylase,  

is subsequently converted to ergosterol. Now 
fungal squalene epoxidase is the target of a group  

of potent antifungals called allylamines, which 
include drugs such as Naftifine and Terbinafine,  

as well as allylamine derivative 
drug called Butenafine. 

The next enzyme, 14α-demethylase is the target 
of a group of antifungals called azoles, which  

include drugs such as Clotrimazole, Fluconazole, 
Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, Miconazole,  

and Voriconazole. Now, by inhibiting squalene 
epoxidase and 14α-demethylase, allylamines and  

azole antifungal agents deplete cell membrane 
ergosterol thereby impairing membrane fluidity,  

leading to accumulation of toxic sterols, 
and ultimately causing fungal cell death.  

That being said, both squalene epoxidase and 
14α-demethylase are also present in human cells,  

and although human enzymes are less affected than 
the fungal enzymes, there is still a potential for  

non-targeted inhibition, which can lead to many 
adverse effects. One of the prime examples of this  

is the non-targeted inhibition of 
human drug-metabolizing cytochrome  

P450 enzymes by azoles, which is responsible 
for many pharmacokinetic drug interactions. 

Now, in addition to ergosterol, another unique 
component of the fungal cell wall, which also  

serves as an attractive pharmacological target 
for antifungal drugs is beta-glucan. Specifically,  

some antifungal drugs have been designed to 
target an enzyme located in the fungal plasma  

membrane that is responsible for the production of 
β(1-3)-glucans called β-(1,3)-glucan synthase. The  

class of compounds known as echinocandins inhibits 
β-glucan synthase, which leads to a decrease  

of β-glucans in the cell wall thereby causing 
osmotic instability, and ultimately cell lysis.  

The example of drugs that belong to this class 
are; Anidulafungin, Caspofungin, and Micafungin.  

Now, the major advantages of echinocandins 
relative to other antifungals include their  

activity against azole-resistant Candida 
strains as well as Aspergillus species.  

Furthermore, because the enzyme 
system for beta-glucan synthesis  

is absent in human cells, 
unlike the other antifungals,  

echinocandins have relatively low potential 
for toxicity or serious drug interactions. 

Finally before we end, I wanted to briefly 
mention couple more antifungal drugs that  

you may encounter in clinical practice, that 
is; Griseofulvin and Flucytosine. So unlike the  

cell-wall-targeting antifunglas that we discussed 
thus far, Griseofulvin and Flucytosine work by  

disrupting fungal cell division via mechanisms 
similar to cancer chemotherapeutic agents.  

Specifically, Griseofulvin binds to 
tubulin, disrupting microtubule function  

and inhibiting fungal cell mitosis, while 
Flucytosine works at the nucleus level where  

it is converted into 5-fluorouracil 
and then to other active metabolites  

that inhibit fungal RNA and DNA synthesis.
And with that I wanted to thank you for watching,  

I hope you found this video useful 
and as always stay tuned for more.
