1
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:11,388
If you lined up all 
the blood vessels in your body,

2
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:15,429
they'd be 95,000 kilometers long

3
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:21,984
and everyday, they carry the equivalent
of over 7,500 liters of blood,

4
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:27,508
though that's actually the same four
or five liters recycled over and over,

5
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:30,041
delivering oxygen, and precious nutrients

6
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:34,960
like glucose and amino acids
to the body's tissues.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,240
All that blood exerts a force on
the muscular walls of the blood vessels.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,066
That force is called blood pressure,

9
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:46,999
and it rises and falls
with the phases of the heartbeat.

10
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,995
It's highest during systole,

11
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,854
when the heart contracts to force
blood through the arteries.

12
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:55,196
This is your systolic blood pressure.

13
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:57,694
When the heart is at rest between beats,

14
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:02,436
blood pressure falls to its lowest value,
the diastolic pressure.

15
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:05,862
A typical healthy individual produces
a systolic pressure

16
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:10,348
between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury,

17
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:14,110
and diastolic pressure between 60 and 80.

18
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,572
Taken together, a normal reading is a bit
less than 120 over 80.

19
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,891
The blood traverses 
the landscape of the body

20
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:24,977
through the pipes 
of the circulatory system.

21
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:26,477
In any plumbing system,

22
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:29,945
several things can increase the force
on the walls of the pipes:

23
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:31,556
the properties of the fluid,

24
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:32,708
extra fluid,

25
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,760
or narrower pipes.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,190
So if the blood thickens,

27
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,437
a higher pressure is needed to push it,
so the heart will pump harder.

28
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:44,782
A high-salt diet will lead 
to a similar result.

29
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:46,933
The salt promotes water retention,

30
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:51,397
and the extra fluid increases the blood
volume and blood pressure,

31
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:54,456
and stress, 
like the fight or flight response,

32
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:58,365
releases hormones, like epinephrine
and norepinephrine

33
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:00,550
that constrict key vessels,

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,211
increasing the resistance to flow
and raising the pressure upstream.

35
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:08,771
Blood vessels can usually handle
these fluctuations easily.

36
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:13,521
Elastic fibers embedded in their walls
make them resilient,

37
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:18,606
but if your blood pressure 
regularly rises above about 140 over 90,

38
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,846
what we call hypertension, 
and stays there,

39
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:23,970
it can cause serious problems.

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,694
That's because the extra strain
on the arterial wall

41
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,456
can produce small tears.

42
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:30,619
When the injured tissue swells up,

43
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:33,214
substances that respond 
to the inflammation,

44
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:36,583
like white blood cells,
collect around the tears.

45
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:41,014
Fat and cholesterol floating 
in the blood latch on, too,

46
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:43,586
eventually building up to form a plaque

47
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:47,694
that stiffens and thickens
the inner arterial wall.

48
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:50,498
This condition is called
atherosclerosis,

49
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,646
and it can have dangerous consequences.

50
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:56,692
If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot
forms on top of the tear,

51
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,605
clogging the already narrowed pipe.

52
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:00,922
If the clot is big enough,

53
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:06,745
it can completely block the flow of
oxygen and nutrients to cells downstream.

54
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:08,374
In vessels that feed the heart,

55
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:10,401
that will cause a heart attack,

56
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:14,892
when oxygen-deprived cardiac
muscle cells start to die.

57
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:17,576
If the clot cuts off 
blood flow to the brain,

58
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:20,266
it causes a stroke.

59
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,991
Dangerously clogged blood vessels
can be widened

60
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:25,797
by a procedure called
an angioplasty.

61
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:28,870
There, doctors thread a wire
through the vessel

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,829
to the obstructed site,

63
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,903
and then place a deflated 
balloon catheter over the wire.

64
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:38,894
When the balloon is inflated,
it forces the passageway open again.

65
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:41,833
Sometimes a rigid tube
called a stent

66
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,118
is placed in a vessel 
to held hold it open,

67
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,747
letting the blood flow freely

68
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:50,280
to replenish the oxygen-starved 
cells downstream.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,911
Staying flexible under pressure 
is a tough job for arteries.

70
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,673
The fluid they pump 
is composed of substances

71
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:59,278
that can get sticky and clog them,

72
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:02,930
and your typical healthy heart
beats about 70 times a minute,

73
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,723
and at least 2.5 billion times
during an average lifetime.

74
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:10,899
That may sound like an insurmountable
amount of pressure,

75
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:15,108
but don't worry, your arteries
are well suited for the challenge.
